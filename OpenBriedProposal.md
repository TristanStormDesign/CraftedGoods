# Open Brief Proposal

## Project Title
**Crafted Goods Platform for Small Furniture Stores in South Africa**

## Background
In South Africa, small-scale furniture stores often struggle to reach broader audiences compared to large retail corporations. These small businesses typically lack the resources for high-end digital marketing or online store development, which puts them at a disadvantage in an increasingly digital marketplace. By building an accessible and user-friendly online platform, Crafted Goods aims to bridge this gap, providing small furniture stores with a place to showcase their products and connect directly with customers.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a digital platform that enables small, local furniture stores to list, manage, and sell their products online. This platform, called Crafted Goods, is tailored to empower these businesses, giving them tools to maintain an online presence and compete effectively with larger corporations. This project ultimately supports economic growth and entrepreneurship in local communities by increasing visibility and accessibility for small businesses.

## Key Features
- **Seller Dashboard**: Each store has its own dashboard where they can add, update, and delete product listings. 
- **Product Listings**: Stores can upload product images, descriptions, and prices.
- **User Access**: Customers can create accounts, view products from various stores, and save favorite items.
- **Comment & Rating System**: Customers can comment on and rate products, giving stores direct feedback.
- **Shopping Cart and Checkout**: A functional shopping cart to facilitate seamless transactions.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Small furniture store owners in South Africa who are looking to reach a larger online audience without the significant financial burden of creating their own e-commerce site.
- **Secondary**: Consumers interested in purchasing unique, handcrafted furniture products directly from local stores, supporting small businesses over large corporations.

## Scope
The project scope includes:
1. **Front-End Development**: Building user-friendly interfaces for the main website, user account pages, and the seller dashboard.
2. **Back-End Development**: Establishing a secure back-end for managing user and product data, seller authentication, and cart/checkout functionality.
3. **Database Design**: Creating a relational database to store store details, product information, user accounts, and order history.
4. **User Testing & Feedback**: Iteratively testing the platform with real users and adjusting based on feedback.
5. **Deployment**: Making the platform live on a server, with a demonstration video to showcase functionality.

## Milestones
1. **Proposal & Initial Setup**: Complete project proposal, initial project setup, and research phase.
2. **Front-End & Back-End Development**: Develop core functionality for product management, user accounts, and dashboard.
3. **Integration & Testing**: Combine front-end and back-end, and conduct testing with small furniture stores for feedback.
4. **Final Adjustments & Deployment**: Implement final feedback, make necessary adjustments, and deploy the site.

## Success Criteria
- **User Engagement**: At least five stores create accounts and upload products within the first month.
- **Customer Transactions**: Facilitating successful transactions through the platform within the first three months.
- **Positive Feedback**: Positive feedback from store owners and customers regarding ease of use, appearance, and platform effectiveness.

This project will deliver a fully functional, easy-to-navigate platform for South African furniture stores to connect with their target audience, enhancing local businessesâ€™ digital presence.
